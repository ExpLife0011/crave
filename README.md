crAVe is a framework developed at [NECSTLab](http://necst.it)  to automatically test and explore the capabilities of generic AV engines.
And it's been developed in order to fuel further research, easing the development of scripts to manipulate malware, submit them to scanners (i.e., VirusTotal)
and retrieve, and analyze results.

## Running crAVe
While crAVe still lacks proper documentation you can find examples of usage in the `examples` directory.
With `craverun.py` you can reproduce the results we presented at DIMVA 2018.
